# ADA Compliance Scanner

A comprehensive, court-ready accessibility scanner that identifies WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations and calculates lawsuit risk based on real ADA litigation patterns.

## ðŸš¨ **THIS IS NOT A TYPICAL ACCESSIBILITY TOOL**

This scanner is designed for **legal defensibility** and **lawsuit prevention**. It goes beyond basic automated testing to provide:

- **Contextual analysis** using AI to understand real-world impact
- **Lawsuit probability calculation** based on actual court cases
- **Business-critical path identification** (checkout, forms, etc.)
- **Production-ready fixes** with exact code implementations
- **Settlement cost estimation** based on company profile

## Features

### Core Scanning Engine
- **Real browser testing** with Playwright (not simulated)
- **Comprehensive element extraction** (images, forms, interactive elements)
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** checking
- **Context-aware analysis** (decorative vs informational content)
- **Performance optimized** for large sites

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **LLM integration** (Claude/OpenAI) for contextual understanding
- **False positive detection** to reduce noise
- **User journey analysis** to identify blocking issues
- **Priority ranking** based on legal risk

### Lawsuit Risk Assessment
- **Real case database** of ADA settlements
- **Industry-specific risk calculation**
- **Serial plaintiff scoring** (1-10 scale)
- **Settlement range estimation** based on company size
- **Immediate/urgent/standard action prioritization**

### Developer Experience
- **Exact code fixes** (not generic advice)
- **Framework-specific solutions** (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Git commit messages** and PR descriptions
- **Rollback instructions** for safe deployment
- **Comprehensive test coverage**

## Real-World Examples

### E-commerce Site Scan

```typescript
const result = await scanner.scanWebsite({
  url: 'https://shop.example.com/checkout',
  depth: 'exhaustive',
  wcagLevel: 'AA'
});

// Common findings:
// - Missing form labels (WCAG 3.3.2) â†’ High lawsuit risk
// - Keyboard inaccessible checkout button â†’ Critical
// - Poor color contrast on error messages â†’ Medium risk
// - Missing alt text on product images â†’ High risk

// Estimated lawsuit probability: 85%
// Estimated settlement: $50,000 - $150,000
```

### Content Site Scan

```typescript
const result = await scanner.scanWebsite({
  url: 'https://blog.example.com',
  depth: 'interactive',
  wcagLevel: 'AA'
});

// Common findings:
// - Skipped heading levels â†’ Medium risk
// - Vague link text ("click here") â†’ Low risk
// - Missing video captions â†’ High risk
// - Auto-playing content â†’ Medium risk

// Estimated lawsuit probability: 45%
// Estimated settlement: $15,000 - $40,000
```

## Understanding Legal Risk

### High-Risk Violations (Immediate Action Required)

1. **Missing alt text on functional images** (WCAG 1.1.1)
   - Lawsuit probability: 80-90%
   - Common in: Shopping sites, form buttons

2. **Keyboard inaccessible interactive elements** (WCAG 2.1.1)
   - Lawsuit probability: 85-95%
   - Common in: Checkout flows, navigation

3. **Form inputs without labels** (WCAG 3.3.2)
   - Lawsuit probability: 70-85%
   - Common in: Contact forms, registration

### Medium-Risk Violations (Fix Within 30 Days)

1. **Poor color contrast** (WCAG 1.4.3)
   - Lawsuit probability: 40-60%
   - Often combined with other violations

2. **Missing video captions** (WCAG 1.2.1)
   - Lawsuit probability: 60-75%
   - Especially for promotional content

### Industry-Specific Risks

- **E-commerce**: Focus on checkout accessibility
- **Healthcare**: Form accessibility and appointment booking
- **Finance**: Login/account management flows  
- **Education**: Course content and enrollment
- **Government**: All content must be accessible

## Lawsuit Database

The scanner includes data from real ADA lawsuits to calculate risk:

```sql
SELECT defendant, settlement_amount, violations_cited 
FROM ada_lawsuits 
WHERE filed_date > '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY settlement_amount DESC;
```

### Notable Cases (2024)

- **Major Retailer**: $150,000 - Inaccessible checkout process
- **Restaurant Chain**: $75,000 - Online ordering system
- **Hotel Brand**: $100,000 - Booking form accessibility
- **Financial Services**: $250,000 - Account management portal

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom WCAG Rules

```typescript
// Add custom business-critical checks
const scanner = new ComplianceScanner();
scanner.addCustomRule({
  id: 'checkout-accessibility',
  name: 'Checkout Flow Accessibility',
  test: (element) => {
    if (element.selector.includes('checkout') && !element.keyboardAccessible) {
      return {
        passed: false,
        severity: 'critical',
        legalRisk: 'high',
        lawsuitProbability: 0.95
      };
    }
  }
});
```

### Industry-Specific Scanning

```typescript
const result = await scanner.scanWebsite({
  url: 'https://yoursite.com',
  depth: 'exhaustive',
  wcagLevel: 'AA',
  industry: 'ecommerce', // Adjusts risk calculations
  companySize: 'enterprise', // Affects settlement estimates
  criticalPaths: ['/checkout', '/login', '/contact'] // Priority scanning
});
