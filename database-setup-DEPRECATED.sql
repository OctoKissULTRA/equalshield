-- DEPRECATED: This file is archived for reference only
-- The live system uses Drizzle migrations in lib/db/migrations/
-- DO NOT RUN THIS FILE - it may conflict with the Drizzle schema

-- This was the original Supabase setup but we switched to Drizzle ORM
-- for better type safety and schema management.

-- To set up the database, use:
-- 1. npm run db:generate  (generate migrations from schema)
-- 2. npm run db:migrate   (apply migrations to database)
-- 3. Run database-worker-upgrade.sql for worker-specific tables

-- Original content moved to database-setup-DEPRECATED.sql for reference
